# Monthly/Expenses Tracker
## About
This program is used to keep track of a person's monthly expenses(the data can be entered by user on daily basis as well). The user can login, then add/view/edit/delete records. I have used Tkinter to create GUI and used SQLite3 to store and manage data in the database.
## Requirements
For this program to run, you must have SQLite3 installed in your computer system along with Python version 3.6 or higher. It is recommended to run it in a system with Windows OS.
## Some glimpses of the GUI
You can create an account by clicking on "Don't have an account" option:

After successfully logging into the account, a new window will open up in which you will see some options in the Menu tab. You can select the option of your choice, then after entering some required details an operation can be performed:
