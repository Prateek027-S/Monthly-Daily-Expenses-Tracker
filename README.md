# Monthly-Expenses-Tracker
## About
This program is used to keep track of a person's monthly expenses. The user can login, then add/view/edit/delete records. I have used Tkinter to create GUI and used SQLite3 to store and manage data in the database.
## Requirements
For this program to run, you must have SQLite3 installed in your computer system along with Python version 3.6 or higher. It is recommended to run it in a system with Windows OS.
## Some glimpses of the GUI
